# check-exercises-app
An app used to check your missing codeup assignments, built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)


*   [Download here](https://github.com/xaviersalazar/check-exercises-app/releases/download/1.0/check-exercises-darwin-x64.zip) and unzip
*   Run the check-exercises.app file
*   After opening the app, you'll also need to goto your *System Preferences -> Security & Privacy* then under click the *Open Anyways* button to open the app. This happens because I  don't have a certificate.

**NOTICE: if the Github API is hit too many times, the app will give you an error*
